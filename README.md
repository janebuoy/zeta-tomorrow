# zeta-tomorrow

zeta-tomorrow is based on [zeta](https://github.com/skylerlee/zeta-zsh-theme), a theme for the ZSH shell. Yet, a few changes have been made:

  - it uses `➜` instead of `ζ` as prompt indicator.
  - together with `yadm-prompt` it displays the yadm status of the current directory.
  - displays IP address if connected through SSH
